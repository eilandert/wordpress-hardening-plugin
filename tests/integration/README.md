# Integration tests — official OWASP CRS images, two engines

The plugin is tested against the **official OWASP CRS Docker images**, one per
engine, so CRS version drift never breaks CI the way a pinned distro package
did. Each image is a reverse proxy in front of a tiny stub origin; this repo's
plugin tree is mounted into the CRS plugins dir.

| Service  | Image                                   | Engine                         | Port |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------|
| `apache` | `owasp/modsecurity-crs:<tag>-apache`    | Apache httpd + **ModSecurity v2** | 8001 |
| `nginx`  | `owasp/modsecurity-crs:<tag>-nginx`     | nginx + **libmodsecurity3** (v3)  | 8002 |
| `backend`| `nginx:alpine`                          | stub origin, returns 200 on every path | — |

The image tag is set in one place — the `CRS_TAG` / `CRS_TAG_NGINX` env in the
workflows (and `${CRS_TAG:-apache}` / `${CRS_TAG_NGINX:-nginx}` defaults in the
compose file). Bump there to move CRS versions; `-dev` tags are not used.

## How the plugin loads

The official image's include chain is:

```
*-config.conf -> *-before.conf -> CRS rules -> *-after.conf
```

The compose file mounts:

- `plugins/` (the real plugin tree: config + before/after + `.data` files) into
  `/etc/modsecurity.d/owasp-crs/plugins/`;
- `ci-plugin/zzz-ci-config.conf` — CI-only: enables the opt-in features (GeoIP
  login control, IP reputation, scanner/REST/wp-cron blocking, strict integer
  params) that ship disabled, and bumps detection paranoia to 2;
- `ci-plugin/zzz-ci-marker-before.conf` — CI-only: the go-ftw `X-CRS-Test`
  audit-log marker (id 999999).

Engine settings (`SecRuleEngine DetectionOnly`, serial native audit log, body
access) come from the image's `MODSEC_*` environment variables, set in the
compose file. DetectionOnly so go-ftw can drive every endpoint and assert on
the audit log without traffic being 403'd.

## Run locally

From the repo root:

```bash
mkdir -p tests/logs/apache tests/logs/nginx && chmod -R 777 tests/logs

CRS_TAG=4.26.0-apache-202605200705 \
CRS_TAG_NGINX=4.26.0-nginx-202605200705 \
  docker compose -f tests/integration/docker-compose.yml up -d

# go-ftw v2 (https://github.com/coreruleset/go-ftw)
ftw run -d tests/regression --config tests/integration/.ftw.yml          # apache:8001
# for nginx, retarget port->8002 + logfile->nginx (the workflow generates
# .ftw.nginx.yml with the libmodsecurity3-specific ignores appended).

docker compose -f tests/integration/docker-compose.yml down -t 0
```

CI runs two **mandatory** jobs with different roles, because the two engines
differ in determinism:

- `.github/workflows/apache-modsecurity2.yml` — **Apache + ModSecurity v2** —
  the blocking **functional** gate. mod_security2 is deterministic, so it runs
  the full go-ftw regression suite (`tests/regression/`) on every rule.
- `.github/workflows/nginx-libmodsecurity3.yml` — **nginx + libmodsecurity3** —
  the **parse/load** gate on the *production* engine. It starts the official v3
  image with our rules (a rule that is malformed on v3 fails to load and the
  container never serves → job fails) and runs a tiny deterministic smoke check
  (`GET /wp-json/` must trip 9522207; homepage stays clean).

> **Why nginx is parse/load, not full regression.** libmodsecurity3 v3 has an
> upstream transaction-handling non-determinism that intermittently drops a
> random rule for one request per run (~10–15 % of full-suite runs, raised by
> host load). It is **not** a plugin bug — the byte-identical rules run green
> and deterministic on Apache + mod_security2. It is not the persistent
> collection either (disabling the rate-limiter did not help) nor request
> spacing (a go-ftw `--rate-limit` made it worse). Gating a *mandatory* check
> on a flaky engine would force retry hacks or spurious red, so functional
> behaviour is gated on Apache and v3 loadability is gated here — both
> deterministic, both first-run.

## Security corpus

`.github/workflows/security-corpus.yml` runs an adversarial corpus
(`tests/security/`) on **Apache + ModSecurity v2** (deterministic, mandatory):

- **`bypass-evasion.yaml`** — attacks obfuscated with case / path-normalisation
  / encoding / header casing that **must still be blocked** (guards against
  bypassable rules; includes the regression for the `t:lowercase` GeoIP fix).
- **`false-positives.yaml`** — legitimate WordPress traffic (homepage,
  admin-ajax, wp-cron, REST sub-paths, assets, whitelisted login) that **must
  NOT** trip any `9522xxx` rule (guards against over-blocking).

Apache only, for the same reason the nginx job is parse/load only: the corpus
needs a deterministic pass/fail and libmodsecurity3 v3 cannot provide one. The
corpus rules are byte-identical across engines, so a real bypass/over-block is
caught here regardless of engine.

> **GeoIP tests + private client IPs.** The GeoIP block intentionally exempts
> private RFC-1918 clients. The CI containers talk from a docker-bridge IP, so
> GeoIP block tests send a public `X-Forwarded-For` (the realistic
> "client behind a proxy" case) — otherwise the exemption would mask the block.

## Files

- `docker-compose.yml` — the stack: official CRS images + stub backend, plugin
  mounts, `MODSEC_*` env.
- `ci-plugin/` — CI-only plugin files mounted into the CRS plugins dir
  (feature gates + PL bump, go-ftw marker). **Never shipped to production.**
- `backend/nginx.conf` — stub origin returning 200 on every path.
- `.ftw.yml` — committed go-ftw config (Apache @ :8001 + pre-existing ignores).
  The nginx/corpus workflows generate `.ftw.nginx.yml` / `.ftw.corpus.yml` from
  it (gitignored).
